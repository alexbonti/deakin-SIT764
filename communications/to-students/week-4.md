# Not started any...

Dear Student,

According to OnTrack, our task tracking tool, you have not yet started any of the tasks for this unit. We are now over 1/3 of the way through the unit, and I am concerned that you will not meet the minimum standard required to pass the unit.

Please note that in order to Pass you are required to have the Pass Tasks signed off as Complete. This requires you to work on the tasks, get them to a good standard, then submit them to OnTrack, and discuss them with your tutor. These tasks form your portfolio, and you are expected to meet certain unit milestones during the trimester.

I strongly urge you to consider your enrolment in this unit. If you cancel your enrolment and withdraw before the census date (31st March) you will receive a full refund and have no academic penalty on your record. If you are planning on continuing with the unit then please aim to have all week 1, 2, and 3 tasks complete as soon as possible.

Please note that changing your enrolment may affect government payments, scholarship or visa conditions, so do check with the relevant authorities before changing your enrolment.

cheers,
Andrew

# Not complete week 1

Dear Student,

I've been checking progress on OnTrack and am a little concerned that you are yet to complete all of the week 1 tasks. Please note that in order to Pass you are required to have the Pass Tasks signed off as Complete. This requires you to work on the tasks, get it to a good standard, then submit them to OnTrack, and discuss them with your tutor. These tasks form your portfolio, and you are expected to meet certain unit milestones during the trimester.

At this stage you should consider how you are studying for this unit, and if you have the time needed to get the tasks done. It is still possible for you to withdraw from the unit before the census date (31st March) in which case you will receive a full refund and have no academic penalty on your record. If you are planning on continuing with the unit then please aim to have all week 1, 2, and 3 tasks complete as soon as possible. You really need to catch up quickly as the trimester is progressing quickly.

Please note that changing your enrolment may affect government payments, scholarship or visa conditions, so if you are planning on changing your enrolment do check with the relevant authorities before changing your enrolment. If you are sticking with the unit then please make use of the various resources available to you. I sent around an email with the details at each week.

cheers,
Andrew
