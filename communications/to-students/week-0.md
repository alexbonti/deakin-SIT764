Hello and welcome to SIT782 Project Delivery. Back into the breach my friends; this unit follows SIT764 where we'll dive back into executing and delivering a project in a multidisciplinary team to our clients. If you haven’t completed SIT764, I strongly urge you to complete that first as we build on the knowledge and skills developed there.

Please check this Program page regularly to stay abreast of news in the unit. You can reply or ask questions here, particularly regarding unit administration. But if your questions relate to specific aspects of course content or assessments, there will be places such as your workshops and cloud seminars that will be more suitable.

There is other essential information about the unit on this Program page such as your unit guide, reading list, assessment details and access to study support.

I look forward to working with you this trimester, especially through our discussions/conversations. Participating in the conversations is one of the many great features in FutureLearn that will enhance your learning. Follow me and other educators to receive updates and notifications. The first course opens on Monday 5th March – see you there.
