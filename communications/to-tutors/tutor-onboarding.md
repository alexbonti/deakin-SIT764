# Tutor Onboarding

## Things to cover:

* Workshop times/location: Workshops only run in the first 5 weeks.

* Class list: Unit chair to download from STAR and share with Tutor.

* What will be covered in each Workshop: See the weekly schedule below, but rule of thumb is to ensure they complete their OnTrack tasks.

* Go over the rubric and conditions to satisfy each grade.

* Content: The content is delivered as "Weeks", but will be relevant **throughout the trimester**.

* Submission schedule: Students **must** submit things weekly. It is their responsibility to ensure they are on track.

* Who marks what?: Refer to SIT782-tasks spreadsheet

* Assessment Q & A: Refer to FutureLearn Week 1 article.

* Communication Q & A: Refer to FutureLearn Week 1 article.

* Project Q & A: Refer to FutureLearn Week 1 article.

## Week 1

###Unit Expectations:

* We **consistently deliver** functionally complete artefacts.

* We are **ambassadors** of Deakin University when interacting with clients, we always conduct ourselves professionally.

* We **seek** knowledge, we do not assume it. When in doubt, first attempt to bridge your gaps, then ask to clarify.

* We **generate and share** knowledge. Find something cool that helped with your project? Share it on the Cloud Deakin discussion board so it might help others.

* We **build** on our prior work and learning experience. This is an execution unit and the second of two capstones that leverages each individuals expertise to contribute to a team project.
