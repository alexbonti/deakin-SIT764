SIT782 Introductions: 

Hi Team (CC’ed),

There is a general SIT782 Slack channel you can all use if you’d like, the link is (let me know if you want me to create a private channel for you): https://join.slack.com/t/sit782-t1-2018/shared_invite/enQtMzI4MjQ3NDgwNDgwLTA5ZmU5MWM4M2JhNmNhODE5NzI1MGUwYjgyMjliOWMxMzE5ZDVjODI1YTlmYTYzNmMwMGQ2YTRhNTAwYjI3OTE
