Dear Project Sponsor,

I hope youâ€™ve had a great Easter break. Thank you again for your participation in the Capstone Programme. We find it helps students contextualise what they have studied and allows them to apply what they have learnt outside of the sandbox they have been trained in. 

Just a quick update, the students are currently on their trimester break. They will return to the fray by starting Sprint 2 from Monday (9th April). You should be receiving a Sprint Increment report from your team soon to keep you abreast of their efforts. 

This marks the end of the on-boarding and planning phase of the projects, I look forward to seeing what they produce! As always, feel free to reach out with feedback, issues or questions to me.
