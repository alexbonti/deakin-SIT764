Dear Project Sponsor,
 
My name is Leonard Hoon and I am the unit chair for SIT782 - Project Delivery for Trimester 1 (March 5th to June 15th) 2018.
 
I am pleased to welcome you to week 0, it is an exciting moment for us, and also one which requires a lot of preparation. Starting from next week (Mar 5th), students will start exploring the available projects and assess their skills and capabilities.

By the end of the second week (Mar 16th), they will be allocated into teams and assigned their supervisors. From Week 3 (Mar 19th) the team together with their supervisor will start making a proper plan and discuss real deliverables.
 
We expect the students to behave and contribute to the project in a professional manner and our team at Deakin will ensure that this happens. But please to keep in mind that they are students and for some of them, experiencing working in such an environment for the first time. For any issues or any clarifications, do not hesitate to contact myself (leonard.hoon@deakin.edu.au) or the project supervisor, whom I will introduce in a separate email after the teams have been allocated.

We will continue to update you in the coming weeks with any matters we may deem important so as to not be too invasive on your time.
 
I would like to once again thank you for the time and opportunity, and I hope this will be a pleasant experience for everyone.
