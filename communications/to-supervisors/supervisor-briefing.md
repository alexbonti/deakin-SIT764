Hi Capstone Supervisors for SIT764 and SIT782,
 
This is the link to screencast recording of the briefing video (video is .mov, you might need VLC player to watch) we recorded this morning: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/w99N8A3LszGEcCE
 
This is the link to the document templates we published to the students (link is for SIT782 but the docs are the same):

This is the link to the unit Slack group, all the students have been invited to it: https://join.slack.com/t/sit782-t1-2018/shared_invite/enQtMzI4MjQ3NDgwNDgwLTA5ZmU5MWM4M2JhNmNhODE5NzI1MGUwYjgyMjliOWMxMzE5ZDVjODI1YTlmYTYzNmMwMGQ2YTRhNTAwYjI3OTE
 
Attached is:
the spreadsheet I went through in the video for the tasks over time
the zip of all the tasks, if you want to verify the instructions given to students
the rubric we went through in the video
 
Once again, this is iteration 2 of the Postgrad Capstone, happy to take your feedback onboard so we can continue to refine it. You should hear from us soon once we have done team allocations. Thanks again for choosing to supervise!
