Dear Supervisors,
 
I hope this email finds you well! I’ve been tasked with redeveloping and chairing of SIT782 – Project Delivery for T1. This is the second postgrad capstone unit (SIT764 – Project Design is part one) where multi-disciplinary teams are formed to execute client projects.
 
In the past month, I’ve reached out to some of you, the Central team and students to capture pain points and elicit requirements in the assessment, delivery and experience of this unit. I’m happy to announce that the assessment rubric has been redesigned to help address the friction that was raised in previous iterations of this. We have worked hard to port these changes to SIT764 to start 2018 with a consistent assessment method in the post grad capstone arena. I welcome all feedback during the course of the trimester, and will continue to incorporate feedback during the trimester so that the next unit chair will walk on to a more refined unit, to set the precedence for these capstones moving forward.
 
You’ll all receive a meeting invite from me soon to on board everyone to the new unit. I’ll also be providing periodic updates so we can share our findings from supervising these different projects, this way we can disseminate the knowledge across all of us. This will be a team effort from all of us to scaffold our student transition from study to practice. I look forward to going on this journey with you.
