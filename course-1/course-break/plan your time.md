# Plan your time

**Getting the most from your intra-trimester break requires a little planning: even if all you want to do is have a well deserved break.**

We are glad you are here â€” so that we can share our tips with you. Do you already have a plan for this intra-trimester break? What are you looking forward to the most this week?

You have achieved a lot already in this unit, including submitting regular assessment tasks so enjoy some 'me' time and reward yourself for your hard work.

Here are some suggestions on how you might make the most of the break:

* Enjoy your break: What is your go-to for ultimate relaxation? What does 'rest' look like to you?

* Reflect on your university study so far: What have you achieved so far? What worked and didn't work in your study?

* Catch up on things you've been wanting to do but haven't yet had a chance	'Have you completed the Preparing to Succeed' course? Do you have half-finished books/projects? Have you caught up with friends and/or family lately?

* Plan ahead for the remainder of the trimester: Are there any Deakin student events you would like to attend later in the year?

## Your task
Stay safe and enjoy your break for whatever you decide to do this week. We trust you spend this week wisely as Deakin postgraduate students.

If you feel comfortable, share your plan for the intra-trimester break in the comments.
