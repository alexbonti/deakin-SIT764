# Personas and actors - the users

**In requirements modeling, actors represent the roles that users, and even other systems, can take with respect to the system, while personas describe specific types of users to help bring the idea to life.**

Personas and actors are a type of requirements model, both used by designers, developers, project participants, and others when designing products, IT systems, and services.

## Actors
An actor is the description of a role within a system. For example, a lecturer and a student are different actors within the university system.

Actors provide an abstraction to the different levels of user roles and personalities, making them easier to work with.

Most roles that interact with a system will be performed by single humans, but roles can also be performed by groups and even external systems.

## Personas
A persona is the description of a fictitious user, who does not exist as a specific person but who is described in such a way that the reader can relate to the description and believe that the user could exist in reality.

Although fictitious, personas bring users to life by giving them names, personalities and often a photo, giving you a clearer picture of who the end-users are and what are their needs.

Personas help identify the user motivations, expectations and goals for using the system, and encourage empathy among technology-focused designers and engineers

## How do we create personas?
There are different well established methods to create personas. The following is a set of steps compiled from existing methods:

* Identify who your users are and why they are using the system. The users can be identified in terms of their goals, motivations and behaviours/attitudes.

* Differentiate users by looking for goals and/or attitudes that are specific and relevant to the system.

* Segment users into distinct groups based on similar goals, patterns and/or attitudes.

* Create personas by including user goals, behaviours and attitudes. Ideally the number of personas should range from 3 to 12.

* Make them realistic by including names, personal backgrounds, photos and quotes.

**Quotes:**

> "Being in a foreign country, away from family is already hard. Learning a new discipline is proving to be very challenging. I need to check the website for some additional material to get started."

Lee Ying is a 20 year old international computer science student. He is very focused in his studies and obtained high grades throughout his schooling in China. He is an introvert and does not have many friends. He recently moved from China to Australia and is still looking for a place to live. He is currently staying in a short term accommodation close to the university and uses the shuttle bus to commute to class everyday.

Lee joined the university in the third week of the semester and one of the units that he is enrolled in is Software Engineering. Lee does not have a computer science background and he is struggling to understand the concepts being taught in class. Due to his introvert nature, he finds it hard to approach the lecturer or his classmates for help.

**Goals:**

* understand the concepts being taught
* get a high distinction in the unit
