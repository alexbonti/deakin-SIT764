# Welcome back

Welcome to Week 3 of content for SIT782!

This week’s content relates to requirements. Requirements are a list of high-level descriptions of what is needed to address a specific problem. They act as an agreement of what a proposed solution must do.

Requirements analysis is essential for the success of a project. Understanding the requirements at the beginning of a project is vital to its success.

Requirements can be broken down into different categories, common categories include:

* business requirements (objectives and expectations)
* legal requirements (compliance with standards and law)
* technical requirements (required operational characteristics)
* constraints (time and resources).

We will explore business requirements, quality requirements and functional requirements.

## Your project this week

This “Week” marks the Start of Sprint 1 in your team. In Sprint 1, you will onboard yourselves to the project, assign your roles and responsibilities, and produce your first iteration of the Scope document using the template provided for the client and your supervisor to review. This is important as it ensures that everyone aligned in the vision of the project.

The articles this week will cover walk you though ensuring that the right problem has been identified, and the ways you can validate your solution direction.
