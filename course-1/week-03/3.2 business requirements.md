# Business requirements

**Business requirements are related to the high-level operation and objectives of the business.**

Consider the following:

* **Business processes:** What are the processes to be automated? Note that the business requirement identifies which processes the solution will automate, not what the solution will do to automate them (the latter are functional requirements).

* **Expected outcomes:** What is the business intending to achieve with the solution? For example, if the expected solution is a specific type of system from many available types, then this must be reflected in the solution requirements. For example, if the business expects an email-based system and not just any type of communication system.

* **Business objectives:** What are the business objectives for the solution? If the business is trying to promote a specific technology, for example, then a business requirement of the solution may be to use that technology.

## Identifying business requirements
Often such high-level requirements are identified early in the analysis process as the business explains its rationale for seeking a new solution.

Business requirements can also be identified by interviewing the executives of the business to obtain more information.

Time constraints, economic constraints and technical constraints can also influence the way in which requirements analysis is performed and which requirements are identified as necessary for the solution.
