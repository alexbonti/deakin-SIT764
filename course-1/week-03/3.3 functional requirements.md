# Functional requirements

**The functional requirements of a solution are the set of actions that the solution must be able to perform to fulfill its intended role.**

Each function of the solution consists of three aspects:

* a set of inputs, which define the data the function requires to perform its behaviour
* a behaviour, which defines what the function does
* an output, which specifies what data is returned by the function.

Functional requirements are shaped by the kind of work that a solution needs to do or assist its users to do. This means there is much variety in the kinds of functional requirements typically encountered in requirements analysis.

## Identifying functional requirements
One technique used to discover functional requirements is to understand the business processes. Existing documentation of the processes and workflows of the client business can be a valuable resource for identifying functional requirements.

Businesses define processes for how they respond to events that occur in the environment; for example, the steps a business performs to carry out a customer order is a process triggered by the event of a customer indicating their intention to purchase an item.

By understanding these processes you can identify what behaviour a solution needs to perform to support or replace the process.
