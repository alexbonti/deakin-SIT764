# How you achieve your Grade

**This unit employs a 100% portfolio assessment, meaning you are assessed holistically throughout the trimester for your final grade.**

## What does each grade mean?

We articulate the conditions of each grade based on what each grade **communicates** to a propective employer and about yourself as a potential employee. Each grade conveys the following message to an employer:

* **Fail:** Do not hire. Student does not produce outcomes, or fails to conduct themself in a professional and respectful manner. 

* **Pass:** Risky hire. Works, but may not produce relevant outcomes.

* **Credit:** Decent hire. Works and produces mostly relevant outcomes.

* **Distinction:** Good hire. Takes ownership of outcomes, producing relevant outcomes while manging time and risks effectively. 

* **High Distinction:** Excellent hire. Demonstrates capability to lead teams and initiatives, takes ownership of outcomes, producing relevant outcomes while manging time and risks effectively.

## How do I know I am on track?

There are several mechanisms in [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au) to monitor your progress, namely:

* Individual Retrospectives: This is the opportunity for your supervisor to provide quick feedback regarding your progress toward your target.

* Team Work Log: This is to contextualise your individual efforts within the project, that is conveyed to both your team and your supervisor.

* Supervisor Meetings: Outside of your OnTrack feedback, these meetings are an opportunity to obtain more detailed feedback from your supervisor individually and as a team.

* Grade Milestones: This accumulates your efforts at checkpoints to help determine if holistically, you are on track for your target grade.
