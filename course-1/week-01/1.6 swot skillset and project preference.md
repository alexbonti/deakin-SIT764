# SWOT, Skillset and project preference

**In order to be assigned a project, you need to indicate your project preferences and your skills.**

Read and understand the available projects, the link to the project briefs will be announced in Week 1. 

## SWOT

You will also need to identify the projects you are best suited for (self-reflection).

To structure your self-reflection, you can use a self-assessment technique called a Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats and Opportunities (SWOT) analysis. Performing a SWOT analysis will help you identify how you can best contribute, as well as your areas for improvement.

Your SWOT analysis will typically fall into the template depicted below.

## Skills

Beyond the SWOT, consider your skill set that you bring to the project team. Ask yourself:

* What are my stronger skills?
* What skills do I want to develop further? Is it web, network, database?
* What do I bring to the project and the team?

For example, if a project requires the development of a mobile app to order food from the local pizza store using smart phones, some of the skills required would be in areas like:

* mobile app development
* knowledge of certain languages (Objective-C, Java, Swift)
* soft-skills like communication, team work, and time management (which all projects need).

If you want to be involved in a given project, as part of your skillset and project preference document, you can indicate, for example:

* that mobile app development has been part of your undergraduate degree and you will be able to take the lead or contribute to the programming of the app

* that you have experience with user login systems, so that the customers can have their own account.

Of course, it does not always have to be programming skills that you can offer. Perhaps you have more knowledge about:

* IT security
* database administration
* client-server architectures
* graphics and multimedia.

The point is that you need to identify your strengths and document how you can contribute to the project and the team.
