# How to get a distinction

**Now that we understand how to get a Credit, how can we achieve a Distinction grade?**

To achieve a **Distinction**, you'll need to satisfy **all Pass, Credit and Distinction** conditions. 

Now that we're in the realm of a **Distinction** grade, we'll move from prescribing how you can satisfy a condition to examples of how these conditions are satisfied. Let's go through some examples of how we can satisfy the different **Distinction** conditions in the rubric accordingly. 

It is up to you, to clearly demonstrate how you have satisfied these conditions. If you are unable to **clearly and succinctly communicate** how you have satisfied this condition, then your work is **not** at a **Distinction** level.

## Takes ownership of component(s) while effectively self-managing time and risk in estimations

* is responsible for (a) specific component(s) of the project
* is generally accurate when estimating the time needed for each task
* generally identifies and addresses, raises or mitigates risk(s) for each task

## Actively works to support other team members to achieve their individual targeted grading goals

* makes the time to check in with team mates to help validate/strategise on how they can achieve the grade they are aiming for
* helps team mates understand why they have or have not satisfied the condition(s) of a grade 

## Deliver work of higher than functionally required quality

* creates a narrated screencast instead of a powerpoint presentation to demonstrate functionality
