# Welcome to Project Delivery

**Welcome to SIT782!** 

This unit follows SIT764 Project Design and resumes your multidisciplinary team's project toward delivery. We make the assumption that you are taking this unit *after* completing SIT764, and will be building on your existing knowledge of project execution in your discipline.

In this unit you will continue to apply everything you have learnt thus far to take a project to from design through to delivery, supported by Agile practices. We will be refining the processes you have been exposed to thus far and going deeper into the realities of your discipline to scaffold your transition from student to professional.

We invite you to learn with and from others. We encourage you to write discussion posts that help you and your peers learn, especially since part of getting a higher grade is to help others! You can also simply 'like' or respond to discussion posts, and follow other learners.

**Please note:**

* that this is the first of 2 courses that make up this unit: SIT782 - Project Delivery.

## Assessment learning outcomes

By the end of the course you will be able to:

*	Devise strategies to analyse contextual business parameters to design and deliver IT solutions using agile or lean project management methodologies, tools, and practices.
*	Use interpersonal and communication skills to manage expectations, prioritise efforts, and resolve both technical and non-technical issues in a collaborative and consultative manner with the project team and stakeholders.
*	Advocate technical and non-technical strategies, approaches and solutions using evidence for informed professional decision making.

You will achieve this by working through a series of tasks that will be presented to you via the platform **OnTrack**. We will introduce you to OnTrack shortly.
