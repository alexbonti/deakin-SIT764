# Environments of use

**Understanding the nuanced combination of the physical, social and technical environment enables you to design and implement more usable products and systems.**

The site characteristics, or environments of use are typically decomposed into three environments, namely:

* The physical environment
* The social environment
* The technical environment

Letâ€™s have a closer look into each of these.

## Physical Environment
The physical environment tends to outline where the system is being used. For instance, an office environment presents very different distractions from a carpenter's workshop.

Some of the key considerations of the physical environment are:

* Equipment: do users wear gloves? Will that interfere with the touch screen? If they use a mouse, are the buttons big enough to interact with when using a mouse and heavy gloves?

* Sitting/Standing: are users expected to be standing or sitting? Is the length of use reasonable to stand or sit for that length?

* Light: is it natural light? Are there alternative light sources? Will bright daylight interfere with being able to see the interface clearly?

* Sound: is it a noisy workshop? Should audio alerts be used in a noisy workshop?

* Wind: is there microphone input? Will the wind interfere with audio capture?


## Social Environment
The social environment tends to describe the non-functional requirements of the system. The social environment characteristics can help shape how the system behaves and responds. For instance, it would ill advised to design an ATM to read out loud the bank balances of customers.

Some of the key considerations of the social environment are:

* Privacy: is it private information being delivered? If I started cycling through apps immediately after viewing my bank balanc

If I was viewing my bank balance via my phone banking app and decided to switch to another app, would my bank balance still be shown if I was viewing/cycling through all of the currently active apps?

* Security: is the information transmitted securely? Was the information confidential? What happens if it leaks out my phone number to every smart phone in Bluetooth radius?

* Support: is there support for the user if a mistake was made? Can they call someone to get help? What happens if I get locked out of my internet banking but I have no means of contacting the bank?

* Stress: does usage of the system cause frustration or stress? What happens if you stress out a surgeon during surgery?


## Technical Environment
The technical environment describes the hardware and physical interfaces that the users will interact with. The design and considerations involved in designing for a desktop PC are different from designing for mobile phones.

Some of the key considerations of the technical environment are:

* Connectivity (eg WiFi, 4g, LAN, etc)
* CPU (eg processing power)
* I/O Devices/Hardware/Usage Interfaces (eg touch screen, keyboard and mouse, etc)
* Memory (eg RAM)
* Screen size
* Screen resolution
* Storage (eg Hard Disk Storage)
