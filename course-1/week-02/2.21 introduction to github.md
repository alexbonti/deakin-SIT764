# Introduction to GitHub

<!-- Video -->

**GitHub is a website and a system used to manage Git repositories.**

There is a distinction between Git and GitHub. If you are going to be using Git or GitHub in your projects, it might be something that you want to look up in some private research. But basically, GitHub is a way of managing Git repositories.

GitHub has a number of features and tools that enable collaboration between developers, usually on a code base. Basically it can be used in any project where you have source such as code files or text files, that you want to manage.

By default GitHub shows you all the files and folders in your repository. Underneath it, you can see it’s showing the contents of this Read Me document. Read Me is probably the most important document in a project. It’s the one that is introduced when you’re viewing a product for the first time.

GitHub and Git can be quite daunting tools but they are extremely powerful. Most development projects use something like GitHub and Git.

## Your task
I’d really recommend you search for GitHub documentation. The GitHub websites and documentation are very thorough, high quality and up to date.

Start with the really early stuff, understanding Git flow, getting started with an example project, before you jump into these big projects that you might be working on.
