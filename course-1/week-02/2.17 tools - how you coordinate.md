# Tools: How you coordinate and organise your work

Using the right tools can make work so much easier, if there is a need, there is likely a software tool that can assist!

Below are some of the specific tools and techniques that we recommend, but this is just a sample of what is available. Don't forget that Deakin has lots of software available to Deakin students for free at the [Deakin Software Library](<http://software.deakin.edu.au/>).

*	[GitHub](<https://github.com/>): Working on IT based projects often involves the development of software or systems. Having multiple team members working on the same software or system can be difficult, and quickly becomes difficult to manage when dealing with difficult code classes and resource files. GitHub is a repository that enables all team members to contribute in a shared environment, thereby reducing the amount of duplicate files being sent around, and eliminating issues such as merging the work of different team members. 

*   [Lucid Charts](<https://www.lucidchart.com>): This tool is invaluable. Use it for wireframing, to organise virtual post it notes for your Sprint Retrospectives, and more! A picture tells a thousand words, you can use diagrams created in Lucid Charts to communicate complex models to various audiences.

*	[Microsoft Office 365 and OneDrive](<http://deakin.edu.au/onedrive>): All Deakin students have access to this free Cloud-based storage! It enables you to upload files and share with the entire team. It provides an easy way to stay organised, reduce duplicate files, and limit time wastage.

*	[Skype or Skype for Business](<https://www.skype.com/en/>): All Deakin students have free access to Skype (and Skype for Business). While face-to-face meetings are ideal, they aren't always possible. Skype provides a suitable platform for team members to communicate through audio, video and screen sharing capabilities.

*   [Slack](<https://slack.com/>): Slack is an instant messaging tool you can use to quickly communicate with your team and possibly, your supervisor and client. In the case where your client is invited to your Slack team, ensure you are inviting them as a guest with specific channel joining restrictions.

*	[Trello](https://trello.com/): Excellent for planning, documenting your project and collaborating with the entire team. Each member can view and edit the Trello board, meaning it can be updated during meetings, and then viewed by any member at any time to ensure that all members are in sync and know exactly where the team is at, what phase the project is at, and what lies ahead.

## Your Task
You can start setting up your tools, including Skype (and Skype for Business, available from the [Deakin Software Library](<http://software.deakin.edu.au/>), your Github account, your Trello account. Doing so now means you can add each other to the team accounts in your first meeting, instead of waiting around while people create accounts. Ensuring your familiarity with these tools now will allow you to hit the ground running with your Team in Week 3!
