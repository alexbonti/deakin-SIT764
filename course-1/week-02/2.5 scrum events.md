# Scrum events

**In this article, we elaborate on the Scrum events that we introduced in the earlier article, to detail the activities and outcomes expected.**

There are four key events to structure each sprint:

## 1. Sprint Planning
A team meeting to determine what to complete for the sprint.

_When:_ Before a sprint

_Attendees:_ Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner

_Duration:_ Typically an hour per week of work (e.g. 2 hours for a two week sprint)

_Activities:_ Estimate the amount of time needed for each feature, prioritise the work within the sprint and assign out the tasks

_Outcome:_ A sprint backlog of user stories and tasks to be completed in this sprint with time estimates.

## 2. Daily Stand-up
Sometimes referred to as "daily scrum", a 15 minute meeting for the software team to make contact.

_When:_ Daily (morning)

_Attendees:_ Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner

_Duration:_ 15 minutes

_Activities:_ Each person outlines what they completed yesterday, what they will do today, and if there are any blockers impeding their progress.

_Outcome:_ Everyone is aware of the state of progress, blockers are raised to the entire team so that the Product Owner or Scrum Master can resolve or re-prioritise.

## 3. Sprint Demo/Review
Post-sprint meeting to showcase the efforts of the recently completed sprint.

_When:_ End of a sprint or milestone

_Attendees:_ Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Product Stakeholders (Optional)

_Duration:_ 30 to 60 minutes

_Activities:_ Developers showcase the new features that have been completed during the sprint.

_Outcome:_ Ensures that the work is truly _complete_ across the team's standards to be demonstrated.

## 4. Sprint Retrospective 
Also referred to as "retro", where the team meets to review and reflect on what succeeded, what did not, how to incorporate success for the next sprint, and how to avoid or circumvent what did not work the last sprint should a similar situation arise.

_When:_ End of a sprint

_Attendees:_ Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner

_Duration:_ Up to 1 hour

_Activities:_ Each member can write on 1 to 3 post it notes, each with a point for what: _went well_, _needs improvement_ and _not to do again_. These can then be grouped for the team to review and identify areas for improvement based on points raised, especially if raised by more than one person.

_Outcome:_ Identified actionable areas for improvement so that the team can do better next sprint.

> * Make this a habit. The Agile methodology is about continuous improvement. Even if only good points are raised, the team can celebrate their successes.

> * Consider scheduling your sprint to start and end in the middle of the week. It is not ideal to stop a sprint on Friday and start on Monday, as any discussion or issues raised would have been forgotten over the weekend.

> * Endeavour to ship (ie. push to production, go live, etc) in the morning and refrain from shipping on Friday (account for timezones if releasing an international system). If anything goes wrong with a live production system, you want the development team to still be around at their desks, instead of having to rush off from a Friday night dinner to hotfix something that has gone wrong.
