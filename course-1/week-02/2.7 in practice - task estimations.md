# In practice: Task estimations

<!-- Video -->

**It is important to estimate the effort required for implementing the items/tasks in the prioritised product backlog.**

The effort estimation takes into account:

* the time required to develop the task, including testing and integration efforts
* the number of people required to perform the task
* any other resource required, such as software libraries
* any risk associated with the task

The task estimation is performed by the scrum team, which includes developers and testers, during the task estimation meetings.

Once the efforts are estimated, the estimated task lists are used for sprint planning, to create the sprint backlog, and then to allocate members/resources to the task.

## Measures of estimation
Several measures can be used to estimate the effort for a task or story. Two of the commonly used measures are *story points* and *ideal days*.

### Story points
Story points measure the magnitude of the story, combining factors such as complexity and physical size into one relative size measure. The size can be specified in different units such as people-days and cost.

In order to provide a relative estimate for the stories, one can select a simple story from the backlog that might take the smallest effort, and use that to estimates other stories’ effort relative to the effort of this simple story.

For example, if the effort for the simple story ‘I as a staff want to save a document in the server’ is 1, then, the effort for the story ‘I as a staff want to save customer information in a database’ can be given by a developer as 10, because the developer might think that this story is 10 times harder than the simple story.

### Ideal days
Another measure used for estimation is the ideal days. This represents the number of days, such as person-days, required to complete a story or task.

In determining the ideal days, it is assumed that the people assigned to that task will perform only that task to completion, without interruption (without multitasking), and with all the resources required to complete it.

## A technique for estimating effort: planning poker
The planning poker technique is a consensus based technique, where the members of the scrum team provide an estimate for a task first in private, and then they must arrive to a consensus through iterations of discussions and voting. This is very useful to obtain a shared understanding of the story/task.

To perform planning poker, the team uses a scale or sequence of numbers to provide an estimate for a task.

It is preferred to use a scale with more numbers at the small end of the range and fewer, more widely spaced, numbers at the larger end of the range. Fibonacci sequence is a commonly used scale for this, which has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ...

For example, a team member might say that he needs ‘5’ days for the task/story of ‘As a user I want to capture the guest information’.

In order to perform the planning poker, the following steps are followed:

1. The product owner selects an item from the product backlog to be estimated and reads the item to the team.
2. The team members discuss the item and clarify the item’s details with the product owner.
3. Each member of the team selects a card (which is numbered in the Fibonacci sequence) representing his estimate. This is a private selection of the estimate.
4. All the team members simultaneously expose their estimates.
5. If everyone has selected the same number, then the consensus is reached, and that number becomes the estimate. If the estimates are not the same, the team members will start a discussion by asking members to provide reasons or justification for their estimates.
6. After the discussion, step 3 is repeated until consensus is reached. Usually consensus is achieved in two or three iterations.

### Estimation example for the Hotel management *software development* project
The video demonstrates how this estimation can be done in practice, using a Hotel management software development example.

In this example, the planning poker method is used, and the scrum master facilitates these discussions.

To present the estimates, which were selected by each team member in private, the ‘show of fingers’ method is used, instead of a card. In here, each finger represents 2 days worth of work/effort.

The number sequence used is 1, 2, 3, or 5, and a 2-week sprint is used for discussion. For example, if one member shows 5 fingers, then that means the task will take 10 days or the whole sprint to finish.

Note that in the number sequence, the number 4 is not used, as if the 4 is selected, it will allow only 2 days left before the sprint ends to adjust for any changes, which may be risky.

There are four tasks/stories discussed in this video for estimation. Each task has different complexities, one task has a simple process for implementation, another task has some requirements that need to be clarified from the product owner, and another one needs comprehensive testing.

## Your task
Watch the video paying attention to how the team members discuss the reasons for selecting a particular effort, if they do not agree with others, how do they reach consensus?
