# Requirements analysis in Scrum projects

**In Scrum projects, requirements analysis occurs to some extent when each Sprint is planned.**

Working closely with the product owner is useful to make sure the requirements are being met. The emphasis that Scrum places on continual interaction with the product owner reduces the risk of setting incorrect requirements early in the project based on an imperfect understanding of the customerâ€™s needs.

The role of the product owner in Scrum has two advantages:

* **Progress feedback:** The product owner only has to wait until the end of a Sprint to see the outcome of the Sprint's work. At this time they can provide feedback to the project team so that the team can align the system with the owner's needs.

* **Information gathering:** the product owner is available for the project team to get information from them frequently. In the traditional process, obtaining information from the client would be limited to the early phases of the project.

In terms of requirements analysis techniques, Scrum teams make use of personas, user stories, usage scenarios and use case descriptions to model the functionality that they are planning to build.
