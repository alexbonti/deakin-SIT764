# User-Centred Design

**Why centre design around users?**

Technology is ultimately constructed to be used by humans. Hence, it is imperative to allow the Human-Computer Interaction to drive the design of any software or technology system. Consider the following products and the impact of user ignorance:

* A Missile Launch System: _All_ the buttons are unlabelled big red buttons.

* E-Commerce Websites: The Shopping Cart icon literally places a shopping cart item in _your_ Shopping Cart instead of displaying what is in your cart.

* Mobile Apps for phones: Putting all buttons on the top left corner of the screen so right handed users have to reach across the screen with their right hand and obstruct screen content from view when tapping a button.

* Mobile Apps for tablets: Not enabling scaling of your interface which presents only a phone sized interface to tablet users.

* Windows Software: Ignoring the operating system user interface conventions and placing your minimize, maximise and close buttons in the top left corner (OSX style) of your Windows application instead of the top right corner.

The impact of this ignorance can range from annoyance to catastrophe. Have a read of [disasters caused by poorly designed interfaces](https://goo.gl/rQgmEZ). As with any product, these issues are preventable with iterative evaluation and validation. In the following sections, we will be exploring approaches that help prevent rise of such problems.

## The User-Centred Design Approach

User-Centred Design (UCD) is also known as [Human-Centred Design](https://youtu.be/musmgKEPY2o). The UCD approach advocates identification and understanding of the Context of Use for the product or system, which is typically decomposed into User Groups, Goals & Tasks, and Environments of Use.

* User Groups, or User characteristics
    * WHO will use the interface?

* Goals & Tasks, Functionality of the interface and Tasks needed to complete the functionality in the most efficient way
    * WHAT is the interface supposed to do?
    * HOW will the user work with the interface?

* Environments of Use, or Site characteristics requiring special interaction mechanisms
    * WHERE will the user use the interface?

There are many ways to go about identifying these points. In this article, we will outline how to structure these criteria in a way that you can elicit such requirements, understanding of the problem and feedback from your client.
