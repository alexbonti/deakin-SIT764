# Welcome back

**This week’s content will refresh and augment your existing knowledge of Agile and Scrum.**

We will recap what Agile and Scrum are, before diving into Lean management and User-Centred Design.

We’ve also made a few videos around the tools you’ll need to use and the Scrum events in practice.

Feel free to incorporate these methodologies into your process, as they will improve the quality of your deliverables.
