# Introduction to Trello

<!-- Video -->

**Trello is a very simple but powerful product management tool.**

Trello is very flexible and can be used in different ways. In the video above, Jake is showing us how this tool has been used in two different projects.

Trello boards are very useful for example, in allowing anyone to breakdown what people in a project are working on, what state things are at, and what still needs to be done.

It’s incredibly simple to use. You can just drag the cards around and each card can have as much or as little information as you want to put in it.

In a card you’ve got room for description, comments, and there are a few actions that can be applied, you can find these on the right hand side. Examples of actions:

* assign a member to a card
* change the labels on a card
* add a checklist, due dates, attachments, images and videos
* move the card around to other lists
* keep track of who made changes in the Trello board and when.
