It’s the tool that developers use to communicate and send messages and other different things. The biggest features of Slack are channels and direct messages. You can create a number of channels over any number of topics. It’s just a way of organising a chat.

You can also do video calling, audio calling, sending messages, audio snippets. You can send zip files. You can use Slack on your computer. You can you Slack on your phone. There’s a number of apps for any operating system. And it’s really easy to use. It’s free to use for basic teams. There is some functionality, like multi-person video calling, which is in a paid tier. But really, 90% of the things you need are accessible in the free tier.
