# In Practice: Stand-ups

<!-- Video -->

**Stand-ups are essentially really short meetings to get everyone across the status of a project.**

A stand-up is not a planned meeting or a spot to raise new ideas. In a stand-up meeting only 3 questions should be discussed:

* What has been done since last stand-up?
* What are you working on until the next stand-up?
* Are there any blockers?

Remember a few key things:

* everything you say needs to be valuable to the whole room
* develop a routine to circumvent procrastination
* start on time; don’t wait around for your team
* keep to the three questions
* don’t ramble; be succinct and communicate effectively
* this is not your sole channel of communication
* **stand, do not sit!**

## Your task
In the video you saw two examples of stand-up. One is a good example of a stand-up, and one is a less good example of a stand-up.

The roles present during these stand-ups were a product manager, a scrum master, and developers. Who do you think performed which role? What areas of improvement did you detect in those stand-up videos? Let us know in the comments section.
