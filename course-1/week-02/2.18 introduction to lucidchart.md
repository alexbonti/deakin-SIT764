# Introduction to LucidChart

<!-- Video --> 

**Let’s learn how to use LucidChart to create diagrams.**

There’s a lot of flexibility and a lot of different type of diagrams you can create.

This video presents a very simple, basic introduction to LucidChart and to the different types of diagrams you can create with it.

To get started:

* create a free account
* create a new document
* select the type of diagram you want to create and chose either a blank or an example diagram
    * blank diagrams are specific for the type of diagram you chose in that they will give you a preset selected set of shapes that are commonly used in that type of diagram
    * example diagrams give you a template, this is useful for styling
* drag in an actual container, which is called a swim lane
* double clicking will let us into text
* drag lines and arrows and add the connectors- if you connect it properly you should be able to just move it around and it will re-size the arrow; then you can just double click on that arrow and see it.

We can always edit the type of diagrams we have. For example, if I want actors I can tick the UML section, and then when I save I will have access to all the shapes in there, including that actor that we wanted.
