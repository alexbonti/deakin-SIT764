# Wrap up

**Yay! Youâ€™ve made it to the end of the content for Course 1 of SIT782!**

Did Sprint 1 go alright? Which life cycle model did you adopt for your project? Did your project require course correction and scope amendments?

These changes are fine, especially in light of new information that might come to light from your implementation.

You should have delivered your first Sprint Increment to your client by now. How did they receive it? What was their feedback?

Practitioner interviews are coming up in the next course!
