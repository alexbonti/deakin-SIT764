# Scheduling the project tasks

**Core to all projects is planning when the work will be done and who will undertake the work of the project.**

Resource and scheduling is broken up into a number of factors, which are explained in this step.

## Task breakdown
After requirements have been identified and established, they need to be broken down into manageable tasks for the project team.

Breaking down a requirement may require discussion between multiple roles within the team, such as designers and engineers. Often there is a need to author a technical specification document that includes the breakdown of a requirement into tasks that can be broken down further into manageable units of work.

An appropriate breakdown of a task can help with the scheduling of work as well as improve estimations.

## Critical path planning
Scheduling the tasks in the right order ensures that the requirements are delivered when they are expected.

A strategy that helps achieve this is critical path planning and works as follows:

1. Determine all of the connections and dependencies between tasks.
2. Determine which tasks need to be completed to deliver the system quickest.
3. Prioritise the project's tasks.

The Critical Path is the minimum length of time required to complete the project. Focusing on tasks in the Critical Path increases the chance that the system will be completed on schedule.
