# Welcome back

Welcome to "Week" 4 of content for SIT782!

Week 4 encapsulates the end of Sprint 1. The Increment expected is the revised, or second iteration of your Scope document with the feedback from your client and supervisor, in addition to the Product Backlog that you will be drawing from for Sprint 2’s Sprint Backlog. Don’t forget to run your Sprint Retrospective, that needs to be submitted in OnTrack!
