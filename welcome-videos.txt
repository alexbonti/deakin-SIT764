Welcome to SIT782

I'm Leonard, your lead educator for this unit. 

I come from the start-up space and am currently a technical product manager with the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (also known as A square I square), where we translate fundamental research into commercial solutions, and I am a lecturer with the School of IT.

This unit has been redesigned in collaboration with: the PMs and Devs at A square I square, the academics from the School of IT, and various practitioners in the industry that I've met or worked with. 

This capstone is designed to scaffold the pragmatic application of everything you have learnt in the context of multi disciplinary client projects, and your transition from study to practice.

SIT782 is the second of two project based capstone units, the first being SIT764. We strongly recommend completing SIT764 first, as we are building on the foundations developed in SIT764.

Capstone units are different from other units you have undertaken. We elaborate on these differences in the week 1 articles, but here are some of the defining features of SIT782:

1) It is delivery focused, meaning that you are expected to consistently produce deliverables throughout the trimester

2) We are using a 100% portfolio assessment. This grade is formed from your weekly deliverables.

2) The grading rubric has been redesigned around communicating a clear message to employers, based on my previous experience as a hiring manager in tech

3) 2 courses are prescribed, but the content is not chronological. This means that content in Weeks 1 to 4 are there to support you in the entirety of course 1.

4) I've interviewed practitioners to get you advice direct form the source around: 
	i) debunking the myths around a role and discipline
	ii) how the role or discipline contributes to projects
	iii) what you should be aware of for your career progression

Let's talk about Course 1. In Course 1, the content will cover the following:
1) Unit administration, including how it works, how you can pass and so on.
2) Agile, Scrum and Lean Project Management. You have been exposed to this in SIT764. Let's go deeper.
3) Problem and solution definition. This helps assess if you are solving the right problem.
4) Organisation and Implementation for Delivery. This will get you started on delivering Increments at the end of each Sprint.

By the end of Course 1, you would have:

1) a clear target grade and a roadmap for how you can achieve it

2) the tools to construct and refine a project scope, inclusive of:
	a) lifecycle model assessment and selection
	b) refinement for the problem definition
	c) performing due dilligence
	d) identifying value proposition
	e) project implementation and organisation to plan and execute
 
Let's roll up our sleeves and get going! You have a few things due this week, namely:
1) Your Individual Retrospective (Every Week!)
2) Your SWOT analysis
3) Your project preference
