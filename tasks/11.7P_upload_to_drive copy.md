## Overview
Upload all of the documents created so far.

## Submission Details

Follow the instructions.  

## Instructions
1. Please Create the following folders and create subfolder as you see fit in here [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lTChCnLunEDv-r9uAgEbDwpyBH27vAsC?usp=sharing)


**Folders** 
**Handover** - everything that ultimately will go to the client, such as documentation and code

**Group-Internal** - all the documents that were created internally, all of your status updates, trello and git page documents that you created in the last week. Also, all of your retrospective.
Also, you will need to include the screenshot of your upskilling certifications, unless there was a very specific reason for not doing the upskilling. Only a few students were allowed not to because they had specific requirements discussed throughout the trimester.

**Final Presentation** - your week 12 presentation. 

**Other** - anything that did not fit the previous folders
