## Individual Pass Task 11.2: Week 11 Individual Retro

### Overview of the task
The Individual Retrospective is a weekly deliverable. In this task, self-assess your efforts thus far to project your grade and outline your reflection of the events of this week. The reflection points in your Individual Retros can differ from week to week. Ensure you are producing the required reflection points.

Use the template provided to help frame your reflection. This document **may not be** confidential, your supervisor may opt to discuss each Individual Retro in your weekly meeting. If you need to communicate with your supervisor confidentially, email them.

#### Submission Details

#### Instructions

1. The articles in Week 1 have described the conditions to satisfy a grade. What grade do you think you are _currently_ going to achieve for this unit? This target grade does not have to be the same grade as previous or future weeks, as this may evolve.

2. Reflect and discuss the following, while bearing in mind that reflection must align with the content in your Team Worklog:

    * **Work:** The work you have done this week in preparation to join a project, and how you plan to achieve the grade you are targetting. This can be listed in point form or as a single paragraph.

    * **Upskilling:** What you did to bridge any knowledge, skill or technical gaps you have identified to be a liability to the project. Evidence this by attaching your spike report(s), online course certificate(s), or a reference what you have produced for the project artefact (eg. Section 2.1 of Scope document, Commit(s): `39b094b3ca92162ab843bf3fa9650c1a959b5cac`, etc).

    * **Product:** Your thoughts in a single paragraph on the team's progress toward the increment for this sprint, and the state of the artefact.

    * **Team:** Your thoughts on how the team performed and worked together this week. Did you find any room for improvement? Did you have to resolve any conflicts?

    * **Communication:** Who supported you in your work this week? Who did you support in their work this week? Why did you need support for your work this week?
