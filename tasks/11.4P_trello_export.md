### Overview of the task
Now that you have delivered your project to your client/sponsor, we start to wrap up our efforts for this project. In this task, your team will need to export your Trello board for submission into [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).

#### Submission Details

4. Open Notepad++ or any advanced Text Editor and use `Cmd` + `V` on OSX or `Ctrl` + `V` on Windows to paste it into the document.
