You can only have the presentation after everyone has created the portfolio, meaning that all the tasks onontrack must have been completed for this reason, i have allocated time in Week 12, but you may do your presentation in week 11 on wednesday or thursday if you have already completed everything else.

**I have left some sessions open upon specific request, please have very valid reasons to do so**

After booking a time, take a screenshot of the excel spreadsheet (please cut it) and upload as proof of your booking.

You will have in total 45 minutes

* **What are we expecting ?**

**Presentation 1 : Your client Pitch 5 minutes**
This presentation will last three minutes, it must provide the user with enough background knowledge to understand the problem and what you were asked to solve. You are not presenting your solution yet, here, you are only presenting the problem. Expect two minutes for Q/A.

The audience may not know anything about the problem, therefore it is your job to make them understand, be sure to test your presentation with a person who doesn't know.

**Presentation 2 : Your Technical Presentation 10 minutes**
It should be similar to the presentation you have done in week 7, minus the problem introduction. 
Explain your technical solution in detail.

**Demo 5 minutes**
Provide a live demo of the application, be sure to make it interesting, build a story around it.


**Journey : 10 minutes**

Use the following points to construct your journey story, you can extend or modify, but keep them within your presentation.

This should be led by the Team Lead or The P/O.
Provide 1 slide in your powerpoint with a summary of all the tasks completed from your trello board, and also a summary of all the team members work hours.
Provide a a short summary of the journey to get here, this can include things like the problems you faced and how you have solved them or showcase it using the sprints outcomes.  
Provide a short description of each team member (from the team lead), between 30 and 60 seconds. This should be more than just "John built the UI", be specific. 
Explain what your feedback in week 7 and what you have done to correct it to be here.

**Final Q/A 10 minutes**
