# SIT782 Project Delivery
## Team Pass Task 3.2: Status Update

### Overview of the task
This Status Update task allows you to communicate your team efforts to your supervisor in the weeks that you do not have a supervisor meeting. You using the template provided to index the work and "billable hour" efforts of all team members for the previous two weeks. This means if the status update is in Week 3, you are to fill in the work done by each team member in Weeks 1 and 2.

Do note that the time you spend on FutureLearn or in meetings with your supervisor and team do not count to these hours.

This deliverable is used to convey your efforts to members of your team and your supervisor, hence the columns for team and supervisor review. The information you provide is used by your supervisor to inform you if you are on track to satisfy the condition of your target grade. Refer to the Status Update template for examples on how to complete it.

#### Submission Details
Submit your status update using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-Project-Delivery/Er_q6e6Iw0pIokUor-k26lQBcAkdM-BWb6PdWwlOxWLxbQ?e=NmuOYy) provided via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).

#### Instructions

1. Ensure the Legend for the Roles and Persons Assigned accurately reflect the team composition.

2. Each new row in the Team Work Log describes an activity with an outcome that you have undertaken for the project. As you complete each activity, fill in each column appropriately:

* **Week #:** Week number)
* **Date:** Date that you completed the outcome in DD/MM/YYYY format
* **Hours:** Hours spent from start of activity to completion of outcome
* **Actioner:** Your name
* **Support(ers):** Names of anyone else involved in the activity (eg. supervisor name for supervisor meetings, client name for client meetings, team member name for shared activity, etc)
* **Description:** A BRIEF description of the activity and outcome
* **Project Impact:** A BRIEF description of how the outcome impacts the project
* **Trello:** **X** to indicate changes were made (eg. moving from TODO to DONE, new card added, etc)
* **Documents:** **X** to indicate changes were made (eg. Scope amendment to version 1.3, git readme updated to reflect new set up procedure, etc)
* **Artefact:** **X** to indicate changes were made (eg. _n_ commits made to repository, database schema scripts updated, etc)

3. An example of shared work is depicted in the Sample Work Log above. If you performed an activity with a team mate, **both** members must add an entry to the Work Log. Rows 3 and 4 of the Sample Work Log above show that Leonard and Andrew worked on the File I/O and Refactoring. Leonard states he spent 5 hours on this to consolidate all the utilities, while Andrew states he spent 1.5 hours refactoring. This reflects the time Leonard spent planning and writing the code individually before Andrew started assisted with the refactoring efforts.

4. **Before** your weekly meeting with your supervisor, your team needs to get together to review the Work Log entries for the week and assess if the time spent and outcome was productive. In the Sample Work Log depicted above, the Team has reviewed the work done by Leonard in row 3 as unproductive, indicated by the **N**, as the team believes the outcome produced should not have taken 5 hours. If the team agrees that the amount of time spent was productive in relation to the outcome, they can indicate so by adding **Y** to the row.

5. **Before** your weekly meeting with your supervisor, download the meeting-minutes template and fill up the agenda with items that you are going to be discussing in the meeting. It is unproductive to conduct aimless meetings. If there are action items from the previous week, copy them over and update the status accordingly, if there are none, you can leave the relevant section empty. Submit this incomplete meeting minutes document via OnTrack, as your supervisor will be referring to this submission throughout the meeting.

6. Conduct your meeting with your supervisor (continue to fill up your copy meeting-minutes document). Your supervisor might have this document up on a shared screen, but will run this meeting according to the agenda you have proposed, adding items as necessary. You might find your supervisor capturing notes using the comments section of the submission in OnTrack for their reference. You should still take meeting minutes for your team regardless. Once the meeting has concluded, your supervisor will typically mark the task `Resubmit`. Once you have cleaned up and completed your meeting minutes document, resubmit it via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). 

7. Your supervisor has the final say. In row 3 of the Sample Work Log, the team assessed Leonard's entry to be unproductive in terms of the time taken in relation to the outcome. However, Jennifer the supervisor states in the weekly meeting that 5 hours was a reasonable time to take, given testing and the fact that everything else in the project relies on it. This is also an opportunity to for your supervisor to guide you if your efforts have been consistently assessed as unproductive by the team and supervisor. After all, a grade condition to receive a **Credit** is to evidence in your Work Log that 75% of your efforts have been assessed as productive and relevant.	

2. Reflect and discuss the following, while bearing in mind that reflection must align with the content in your Team Worklog:

    * **Work:** The work you have done this week in preparation to join a project, and how you plan to achieve the grade you are targetting. This can be listed in point form or as a single paragraph.

    * **Upskilling:** What you did to bridge any knowledge, skill or technical gaps you have identified to be a liability to the project. Evidence this by attaching your spike report(s), online course certificate(s), or a reference what you have produced for the project artefact (eg. Section 2.1 of Scope document, Commit(s): `39b094b3ca92162ab843bf3fa9650c1a959b5cac`, etc).

    * **Product:** Your thoughts in a single paragraph on the team's progress toward the increment for this sprint, and the state of the artefact.

    * **Team:** Your thoughts on how the team performed and worked together this week. Did you find any room for improvement? Did you have to resolve any conflicts?

    * **Communication:** Who supported you in your work this week? Who did you support in their work this week? Why did you need support for your work this week?


1. Conduct your Sprint Retrospective amongst your team to identify activities and processes to be classified, discussed and resolved or sorted into either the **Start**, **Continue** or **Stop** category.

2. List these activities using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-Project-Delivery/Er_q6e6Iw0pIokUor-k26lQBcAkdM-BWb6PdWwlOxWLxbQ?e=NmuOYy) provided. You only need to mention things that you will **Continue** to do once. If you have listed it as a **Continue** in your Sprint 1 Retrospective, you do not need to list it again in subsequent retros. Produce **at least two per category per Sprint Retro**. Here is an example of a Sprint Retro submission:

    * **Things the team will START doing:**
        * Team communication (emails, Slack, etc) should be responded to within 24 hours.
        * Use `NEW:`, `UPDATE:`, `FIX:` tags as a prefix for all commit messages to enable easier search (Leonard to enforce from Monday the 2nd onwards)

    * **Things the team will CONTINUE doing:**
        * Stand-ups (10 mins max) will happen 3 times a week at 8AM using the recurring Skype online meeting place (Laura to enforce and ensure Skype meeting invite is set up properly)
        * Team will continue with the new recurring supervisor meeting on Monday at 2PM so that supervisor feedback can be actioned during the week
        * Use GitHub Pull Requests when major components are commited that can break existing functionality so that it can be reviewed by other team members (Andrew to enforce)

    * **Things the team will STOP doing:**
        * Code snippets in emails. Use the Slack snippet functionality
        * Using `temp` as a variable name. Seriously. (Leonard to enforce)
