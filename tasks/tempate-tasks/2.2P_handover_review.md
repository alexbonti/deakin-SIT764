# SIT782 Project Delivery
## Team Pass Task 2.2: Handover Review and Project Scope

### Overview of the task
This task involves review of the handover material produced in SIT764 to onboard the team to the project. Use these materials to prepare an updated project scope document that details how your team will execute the project this trimester. The completeness of the document is not as important as capturing points for each section so that your team can demonstrate to your client and supervisor that you share a common understanding of the project.

#### Submission Details
Submit your draft Scope document as a **pdf** using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-Project-Delivery/Er_q6e6Iw0pIokUor-k26lQBcAkdM-BWb6PdWwlOxWLxbQ?e=NmuOYy) provided via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).

#### Instructions

1. Populate each section in the template provided that you are able to based on the handover materials. This is to ensure that you do not go to your meetings empty handed, and it affords early course correction for the project.

2. If you do not have existing handover material from a previous team due to the project starting only in this unit, prepare a project scope using the template provided.

3. Export as a **pdf** and submit via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).
