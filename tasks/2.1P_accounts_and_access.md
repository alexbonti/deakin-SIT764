### Overview of the task
To fulfill the requirements of this task, your group needs to provide evidence that you have added your supervisor to all relevant management tools/systems. This includes things such as:

* Github

It will be your responsibility as a team to identify the appropriate systems which your supervisor and the unit chair needs access to.
