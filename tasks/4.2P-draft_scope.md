# SIT764 Project Delivery
## Team Pass Task 4.2: Draft Scope

### Overview of the task
This task is about producing your first draft of the scope document for your client and supervisor to review, from the project brief of the project you have been assigned to. The completeness of the document is not as important as capturing points for each section so that your team can demonstrate to your client and supervisor that you share a common understanding of the project.

#### Submission Details
Submit your draft Scope document as a **pdf** using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EYV-jyiKNbJArNamIMKVvLMB_9MHZ6NDacdCn92Jb0to-g?e=BnLYeT) provided via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).

#### Instructions

1. List points of content for each section in the template provided that you are able to based on the project brief. This is to ensure that you do not go to your client meeting empty handed, and it sets precedence for your client to course correct the direction of the project early, if the team misinterprets the project brief.

2. Export as a **pdf** and submit via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).
