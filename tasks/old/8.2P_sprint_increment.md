# SIT782 Project Delivery
## Team Pass Task 8.2: Week 8 Sprint 3 Increment

### Overview of the task
The Sprint Increment is the completed deliverable that is produced at the end of each Sprint. The increment can take many shapes, however it must be in alignment with the project scope of work. Here are examples of Sprint Increments for each type of project:

* cyber-security project: a security and technical report of the artefact under test
* data analytics project: the schema(s), set-up and tear-down scripts for the data persistence layers
* data science or research project: a research report about the algorithm or research problem
* software development project: software artefact with (a) new feature(s) and no regression

If a GitHub repository is used for any of the projects, you can supplement your increment with by tagging a release in git.

In addition to the Increment, it is common to support the Increment with:

* a document or video outlining the progress that has been completed
* if the project is still on track for completion on time
* suggestions for scope amendments, due to new discoveries

This is a **team** submission. Submit only one Sprint Increment at the end of **each** Sprint.

#### Submission Details
Submit your Sprint Increment and supporting artefacts via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). Some templates are provided to frame your supporting artefacts.

#### Instructions

1. Consolidate what the team has produced into a deliverable Sprint Increment. The Sprint Increment must be complete enough to exist in isolation if the project were to suddenly seize after the Sprint ends.

2. Produce your supporting artefacts. The **minimum requirement** for a supporting artefact is to complete the Sprint Increment Report using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EjtriPJQ6B1NuMrb9WI59oMB_UKn0Ui6ewP4ONJTzmFVLg?e=rp2vwG) provided. This document is used to update your client/sponsor of the progress of the project.

3. If you are aiming to achieve a Distinction or higher, you can work toward satisfying the grade condition of `Deliver work of higher than functionally required quality` by producing deliverables to augment your Sprint Increment. Examples of what you could produce are:

* a screen cast video with audio commentary walking through the new features of the software artefact that was completed this sprint
* a screen cast video with audio commentary walking through security vulnerabilities or penetration testing for the artefact
* a git tagged release for the work completed this Sprint with updated regression test scripts
* a bug report compiling all bugs that have been flagged and resolved with test plans to ensure against regression
* if you have an idea, feel free to discuss it with your supervisor to determine if it meets the grade condition

4. Once your supervisor has marked the Sprint Increment as **Complete**, you may export it as a pdf to be sent to your client/sponsor.
