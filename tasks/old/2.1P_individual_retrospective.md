#### Instructions

1. The articles in Week 1 have described the conditions to satisfy a grade. What grade do you think you are _currently_ going to achieve for this unit? This target grade does not have to be the same grade as previous or future weeks, as this may evolve.

2. Reflect and discuss the following:

    * **Work:** The work you have done this week in preparation to join a project, and how you plan to achieve the grade you are targetting. This can be listed in point form or as a single paragraph.

    * **Upskilling:** What you did to bridge any knowledge, skill or technical gaps you have identified to be a liability to the project (assume you are working on your 1st project preference). Evidence this by attaching your spike report(s) or online course certificate(s).

    * **Product:** Your thoughts on the context of use for the primary users of the product(assume you are working on your 1st project preference). List this in points or express this within a single paragraph.
