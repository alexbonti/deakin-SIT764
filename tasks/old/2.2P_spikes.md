# SIT782 Project Delivery
## Individual Pass Task 2.2P: Spikes

### Overview of the task
A Spike, defined by the [Agile Dictionary](http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/) is a task or story that is undertaken to bridge a gap in knowledge, skill or technology. Spiking helps teams dispel fears, doubts and uncertainties, especially with time estimations for work. A spike **must** have a **binary problem** (ie. solved or not solved) and **justified recommendation(s)** for which action to take. Use the structure detailed in the Instructions to produce Spike Reports to communicate what your learning to others.

For this Spike, identify a gap that you have in relation to the project you want to undertake and bridge the gap. Present your Spike report to your project team in Week 3 if it is relevant.

#### Submission Details
Submit your Spike Report using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EjtriPJQ6B1NuMrb9WI59oMB_UKn0Ui6ewP4ONJTzmFVLg?e=rp2vwG) provided via OnTrack.

#### Instructions

1. Scope and identify if your Spike is a knowledge, skill or technology Spike.

2. Once you have identified the type of gap you are bridging, propose a binary question that you can answer via your spike. Examples of this are:

* **Knowledge:** Identify the most appropriate lifecycle model to adopt given the problem and constraints of the project.

* **Skill:** Connect and perform postgresql CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations to a persistent database via command prompt.

* **Technical:** Identify which object relational mapping framework should be used while maintaining integrity of the existing data.

3. Identify and **execute at least 3 solutions** to address the acceptance criteria of the spike. Solving a problem 3 ways provides a holistic understanding of the problem while avoiding confirmation bias and choice paralysis.

4. Present your findings using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EjtriPJQ6B1NuMrb9WI59oMB_UKn0Ui6ewP4ONJTzmFVLg?e=rp2vwG) provided to your team to share your new knowledge. Consider setting up a separate branch in your repository for spikes.

5. Submit your mandatory Week 2 Spike via OnTrack. Subsequent Spikes should be logged in your Team Work Log **and** have the Spike Report attached to your Individual Retrospective for the week. Spikes beyond Week 2 _might_ help satisfy **Deliver higher than functionally required quality** (Check with your supervisor).
