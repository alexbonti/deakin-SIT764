# SIT782 Project Delivery
## Team Pass Task 4.2: Team Work Log and Supervisor Meeting

### Overview of the task
Your Team Work Log is a shared document that indexes the work and "billable hour" efforts of all team members. This shared document is updated whenever you have completed a body of work to product an outcome. A side effect of this Work Log is that you have to scope your activities and outcomes into small artefacts that you can deliver.

Your Team Work Log is also used to convey your efforts to members of your team and your supervisor, hence the columns for team and supervisor review. The information into the Work Log is also used by your supervisor to inform you if you are on track to satisfy the condition of your target grade. A sample of how to fill up the Work Log is depicted below.

#### Submission Details
Update your Team Work Log regularly, this does not have to be submitted until the end of the Trimester, but will be reviewed by your supervisor in your weekly supervisor meeting. Submit your meeting minutes using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EjtriPJQ6B1NuMrb9WI59oMB_UKn0Ui6ewP4ONJTzmFVLg?e=rp2vwG) provided via [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au).

#### Instructions

1. Ensure the Legend for the Roles and Persons Assigned accurately reflect the team composition.

2. Each new row in the Team Work Log describes an activity with an outcome that you have undertaken for the project. As you complete each activity, fill in each column appropriately:

* **Week #:** Week number)
* **Date:** Date that you completed the outcome in DD/MM/YYYY format
* **Hours:** Hours spent from start of activity to completion of outcome
* **Actioner:** Your name
* **Support(ers):** Names of anyone else involved in the activity (eg. supervisor name for supervisor meetings, client name for client meetings, team member name for shared activity, etc)
* **Description:** A BRIEF description of the activity and outcome
* **Project Impact:** A BRIEF description of how the outcome impacts the project
* **Trello:** **X** to indicate changes were made (eg. moving from TODO to DONE, new card added, etc)
* **Documents:** **X** to indicate changes were made (eg. Scope amendment to version 1.3, git readme updated to reflect new set up procedure, etc)
* **Artefact:** **X** to indicate changes were made (eg. _n_ commits made to repository, database schema scripts updated, etc)

3. An example of shared work is depicted in the Sample Work Log above. If you performed an activity with a team mate, **both** members must add an entry to the Work Log. Rows 3 and 4 of the Sample Work Log above show that Leonard and Andrew worked on the File I/O and Refactoring. Leonard states he spent 5 hours on this to consolidate all the utilities, while Andrew states he spent 1.5 hours refactoring. This reflects the time Leonard spent planning and writing the code individually before Andrew started assisted with the refactoring efforts.

4. **Before** your weekly meeting with your supervisor, your team needs to get together to review the Work Log entries for the week and assess if the time spent and outcome was productive. In the Sample Work Log depicted above, the Team has reviewed the work done by Leonard in row 3 as unproductive, indicated by the **N**, as the team believes the outcome produced should not have taken 5 hours. If the team agrees that the amount of time spent was productive in relation to the outcome, they can indicate so by adding **Y** to the row.

5. **Before** your weekly meeting with your supervisor, download the meeting-minutes template and fill up the agenda with items that you are going to be discussing in the meeting. It is unproductive to conduct aimless meetings. If there are action items from the previous week, copy them over and update the status accordingly, if there are none, you can leave the relevant section empty. Submit this incomplete meeting minutes document via OnTrack, as your supervisor will be referring to this submission throughout the meeting.

6. Conduct your meeting with your supervisor (continue to fill up your copy meeting-minutes document). Your supervisor might have this document up on a shared screen, but will run this meeting according to the agenda you have proposed, adding items as necessary. You might find your supervisor capturing notes using the comments section of the submission in OnTrack for their reference. You should still take meeting minutes for your team regardless. Once the meeting has concluded, your supervisor will typically mark the task `Resubmit`. Once you have cleaned up and completed your meeting minutes document, resubmit it via OnTrack. 

7. Your supervisor has the final say. In row 3 of the Sample Work Log, the team assessed Leonard's entry to be unproductive in terms of the time taken in relation to the outcome. However, Jennifer the supervisor states in the weekly meeting that 5 hours was a reasonable time to take, given testing and the fact that everything else in the project relies on it. This is also an opportunity to for your supervisor to guide you if your efforts have been consistently assessed as unproductive by the team and supervisor. After all, a grade condition to receive a **Credit** is to evidence in your Work Log that 75% of your efforts have been assessed as productive and relevant.
