# SIT782 Project Delivery
## Team Pass Task 6.3: Week 6 Sprint Retro

### Overview of the task
The Sprint Retrospective is an important activity to help the team continually improve. We do this by reflecting on which activities or processes went well during the sprint and to propose resolutions to what did not go well. For the unsucessful activities, actions and resolutions should also be discussed.

This is a **team** submission. Submit only one Sprint Retro at the end of **each** Sprint.

#### Submission Details
Submit your Sprint Retrospective using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EjtriPJQ6B1NuMrb9WI59oMB_UKn0Ui6ewP4ONJTzmFVLg?e=rp2vwG) provided via OnTrack.

#### Instructions

1. Conduct your Sprint Retrospective amongst your team to identify activities and processes to be classified, discussed and resolved or sorted into either the **Start**, **Continue** or **Stop** category.

2. List these activities using the [template](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/SIT782-t1-2018/EjtriPJQ6B1NuMrb9WI59oMB_UKn0Ui6ewP4ONJTzmFVLg?e=rp2vwG) provided. You only need to mention things that you will **Continue** to do once. If you have listed it as a **Continue** in your Sprint 1 Retrospective, you do not need to list it again in subsequent retros. Produce **at least two per category per Sprint Retro**. Here is an example of a Sprint Retro submission:

    * **Things the team will START doing:**
        * Team communication (emails, Slack, etc) should be responded to within 24 hours.
        * Use `NEW:`, `UPDATE:`, `FIX:` tags as a prefix for all commit messages to enable easier search (Leonard to enforce from Monday the 2nd onwards)

    * **Things the team will CONTINUE doing:**
        * Stand-ups (10 mins max) will happen 3 times a week at 8AM using the recurring Skype online meeting place (Laura to enforce and ensure Skype meeting invite is set up properly)
        * Team will continue with the new recurring supervisor meeting on Monday at 2PM so that supervisor feedback can be actioned during the week
        * Use GitHub Pull Requests when major components are commited that can break existing functionality so that it can be reviewed by other team members (Andrew to enforce)

    * **Things the team will STOP doing:**
        * Code snippets in emails. Use the Slack snippet functionality
        * Using `temp` as a variable name. Seriously. (Leonard to enforce)
