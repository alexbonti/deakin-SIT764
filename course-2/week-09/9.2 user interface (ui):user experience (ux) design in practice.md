# User interface (UI)/user experience (UX) design in practice

##Is there more to UI/UX than drawing interfaces?

**Olga Goloshchapova:**

"There is a lot of evaluation that is happening. It's actually quite a significant impact between making five clicks versus two clicks, depending on your use case. You have to understand how the human behaves."

**Damien Manuel:**

"You have to think about the way that somebody uses the technology and even how different people from different cultural backgrounds or different age groups might use that technology because you need to design the flow of the system, as well as the visual appeal, to make sure that people can use it in a way that fits their lifestyle, which is– that's really key."

**Olivia Platek:**

"It's not just what does our web page look like, what does our app look like, but how does the whole piece integrate with what else is going on. How does it integrate with, say, the marketing plans with the wording across the whole brand, with what the stores feel like, look like? So how does everything fit in together?” You might also just be the sort of person who just wants to design. And that's OK, too. I think there's sort of very different buckets or hats to work within."

Andrew Vouliotis:

"There's a lot of thought about the way that information is displayed, how data has to get retrieved."
