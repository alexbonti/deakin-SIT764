# Prototype Fidelity

**Nobody enjoys wasted effort. How much effort do you think you should put into your prototype? In a nutshell, it depends.**

## The prototype fidelity spectrum

The fidelity of a prototype can vary, meaning it does not have to look like a finished product. Prototype fidelity refers to the level of detail and realism of the prototype in contrast to what you envision as the final product. The fidelity spectrum runs from low to high fidelity. 

A high fidelity product tends to be very highly polished and animated with similar or final graphic assets that will be used in the product's release. A low fidelity prototype could be a paper prototype employing liberal use of post-it notes on a sheet of paper.

Fidelity can vary in terms of the level of: 

* **Content:** Are you using content that mimics the real content of the product or are you using Lorem Ipsum to simulate content?

* **Interactivity:** Are all the animations and interact-able (eg. buttons, scrollbars, etc.) elements working?

* **Visual aesthetic:** Are the graphic assets being used the final proofs or does it look like it was sketched using stationary? Are all the styles in place? 

You can decided on the level of fidelity for each of these components based on what you are trying to test with the prototype. If you are testing the product concept, then the content and interactivity would likely be more important than the visual aesthetic. If you are testing the usability of the product, you can focus on the interactivity and visual aesthetic instead while using placeholder content.

## Low-fidelity prototyping
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick way to translate your abstract concepts and designs into a testable artefact. Lo-fi prototypes are generally used to validate product features or functionality.

Low-fidelity prototyping have the following characteristics:

* **Content:** Only the content that is necessary for the tasks is included, placeholders or Lorem Ipsum may be used for the rest to serve as placeholder content. Do note the risk that this automatically indicates to the test participant which content is relevant to the task and can introduce bias to your effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction scores. 

* **Interactivity:** The prototype has simulated interactiveness that can be tested by a human. During testing, a person who is familiar with design (a project team member) plays the role of the computer, where they manually change the prototype's state in real-time (refer to [this video from UX Playground](https://youtu.be/yafaGNFu8Eg) as an example). Another example of interactivity is to use a tool like Powerpoint or Keynote and create slides representing each screen and linking them together with click-able regions.

* **Visual aesthetic:** Not all the visual elements of the product are presented. Placeholders may be used to indicate basic visual hierarchy.

### Lo-fi Pros

* **Cost:** Lo-fi prototyping tends to be a very inexpensive endeavour.

* **Speed:** A paper prototype can be created in minutes, allowing a trial and error exploration of ideas with minimal effort.

* **Collaboration:** Due to the speed and low cost of lo-fi prototyping, it affords the opportunity to involve all team members, regardless of expertise to collaboratively design.

* **Clarification:** Having tangible, testable prototypes will clarify expectations across your team and the project stakeholders.

### Lo-fi Cons

* **Limited Interactivity:** The nature of lo-fi prototypes will not work for complex animations or transitions.

* **Participant Uncertainty:** Due to the lo-fi nature of the prototype, test participants can get confused about which parts of the prototype system are supposed to "work". This can skew your findings/results.

## High-fidelity prototyping
High-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes look and feel very similarly to the product you will ship. Hi-fi prototypes tend to only be created to refine product features after the requirements of a project have been fully discovered. These hi-fi prototypes are used to validate the product with real end-users and stakeholders.

High-fidelity prototyping have the following characteristics:

* **Content:** Real or very close to real and complete content is used for this level of prototyping. This amount and quality comes with the trade-off that it takes longer to produce (if simulated) or collect (if real).

* **Interactivity:** The prototype has the same interactiveness as the shipped product. This inherently also means that complex or highly animated workflows can be tested.

* **Visual aesthetic:** All interface elements including spacing and graphic assets of the product are presented. 

### Hi-fi Pros

* **Buy-in:** Your project sponsors and stakeholders have a very tangible and testable prototype that serves as a great demonstration of how the product works.

* **Clarification:** Meaningful feedback is garnered due to the completeness of the prototype, as participants will interact naturally with the prototype like the real product.

* **Depth of Testing:** Due to the realism of a hi-fi prototype, you can test specific UI elements, interactions or workflow. This is particularly important when introducing innovative workflows for your users to test the learning curve.

### Hi-fi Cons

* **Cost:** A hi-fi prototype is not very different from a working front-end. This incurs significantly higher costs, in both money and time.
