# Considering emotions
**For Anju, successful projects are those where the technology is adopted and used for a longer period of time. For her, considering end users emotional expectations is essential for success.**

"Like we say function and non-function requirements. But then very often we forgo what people actually want to feel when they are using this technology. So all the projects that I have worked on have focused mainly on these emotion expectations as well."

"Especially when you are using technology like socially-oriented technology, then you have to design really for these end-users, to be used in their homes. So there it's like these emotional expectations have been placed at a higher priority compared to the function and the quality goals."

## Your task
Do you agree with Anju on this? Is there a technology that you think considers your emotional expectations? Had you ever thought about technology in this way?
