# What to consider in UI/UX design?

**What does "keeping the user in mind" mean to you?**

**Damien Manuel:**

"So it means when you design something, from day one, you're designing it with that market segment that you are targeting in mind."

**Anju Curumsing:**

"when people say that they want something specific and they're expressing their emotional goals, like when they're using the software, they want to feel safe. So then the question arises, how do I design the technology to make the person feel safe?"

**Olivia Platek:**

"I've been in projects or in companies where the key stakeholders say that they know better than their customers. Because they know so much more about the different use cases and then know so much about the various pain points that they can make the decisions. But ultimately, they are not their own customers. And so I think it's really important to go out and to understand what it is that the customer's saying."

**Wayne Buchner:**

"If you have to explain something to somebody, it's not working."
