# Kathryn Manuel - Creating your own opportunities

**Kathryn is the Portfolio Manager for Group Cyber Governance at Commonwealth Bank.**

"In terms of getting into IT, that was a very long, roundabout journey that took many different paths. But fundamentally, I came to it through project management. It's such a very diverse field."

"I have been willing to step outside my comfort zone, and I think that's vital if you want to progress in your career. But I think, really, the fundamental, key thing is actually people skills."

"So it's the people skills, and they're so often undervalued or overlooked when we're going through our degrees and things. But they are the absolute basis of everything that we do. So for me, I think it's making sure that I never lose focus on my people skills, how am I interacting with people, and making sure that it's always a quality interaction. It can't always be a positive interaction."
