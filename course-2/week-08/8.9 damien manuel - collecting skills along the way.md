# Damien Manuel - collecting skills along the way

**Damien is the Director for Cyber Security Research and Innovation at Deakin University.**

He's been in cyber security for over 20 years.

"And there's a little bit within that field for anybody, in terms of whether you want to take up auditing, whether you wanted to look at risk management, whether you wanted to do cyber security from a project management perspective, or whether you're an individual who thinks a little bit differently and wants to go down the investigation, sort of crime, discovery, forensics path as well. So it's got something for everybody."

"The thing that you need to be careful of though, is if you do become a generalist in cyber security, because it's so broad, you need to keep in your back pocket a few areas where you can still specialise in so that if you do need to move into that area because the industry has shifted or changed, you've got that ability to do that."
