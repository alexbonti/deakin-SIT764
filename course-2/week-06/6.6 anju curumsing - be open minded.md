# Anju Curumsing - be open minded

**Anju is the Hub Manager of the ARC Industrial Transformation Hub for Digital Enhanced Living.**

Anju studied information systems, then did a master's in software engineering and recently completed a PhD in software engineering.

Anju's job is focused on digital enhanced living, trying to create some affordable technology to improve the quality of life of elderly people, those disabled, and those who need physical assistance or mental assistance.

"When I came here, that was really a big shock to me, especially when I visited a few elderly people and then I found that their relatives didn't have time to go and visit them. So my heart really went out to them, and I really wanted to do something for them. So this area is just fascinating, and I just wanted to do something in this area."
