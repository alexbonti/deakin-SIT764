# Andrew Vouliotis - find out what motivates people

**Andrew is a Product Manager for Deakin University's Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute.**

Andrew studied a Bachelor of Information Technology, which is a scholarship information systems course.

According to Andrew, being a product manager goes almost hand-in-hand with business analysis because a lot of the responsibilities are quite similar but just at a slightly more senior level.

"The role itself has long hours because you may be on the phone late at night with clients trying to solve problems or just chatting about their ideas. It's also being able to have some form of work-life balance."
