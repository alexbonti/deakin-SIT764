# Olivia Platek - focus on team happiness

**Olivia is an IT and Business Project Consultant at ThoughtWorks.**

Olivia studied a Bachelor of Information Technology.

Her job is to go into a project team, usually a team of software developers, help them work more cohesively, help them work faster.

"So a number of times when I go into teams they're individuals working on their own pieces, not really communicating, not really helping each other out. But they're also under a large amount of delivery pressure."

"I do all of this stuff they don't want to do, which tends to be quite soft skill related, as well as a little bit sort of team management related. And then I try and take away some of that pain, help them to work a bit better, and then reintroduce the pieces that I've been doing. So to make myself redundant."
