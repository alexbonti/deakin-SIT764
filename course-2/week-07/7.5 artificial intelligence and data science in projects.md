# Artificial intelligence and data science in projects

**What are the main risks and priorities in artificial intelligence and data science projects?**

## Risks
Shareholder involvement, the client in particular seems to be a big risk in these projects.

**Nicola Pastorello:**

"interactions with clients are probably where most of the issues are."

For Elodie, who works in data science, the risk is that, being a fast paced field, someone beats you with their results.

## Priorities

**Elodie Thilliez:**

First, come up with a solution. Present the solution to the client, and then optimise that solution. Once they're really interested, then you can take your time to actually refine your solution and do a bit more in depth work.

**Mohamed Abdelrazek:**

I would say there are two models:

1. driven by technology innovation

2. client oriented or customer oriented, so basically building things that the client needs.

**Nicola Pastorello:**

Depends on what kind of project you have. If it's just exploration:

1. the first priority is to get the data in a useful form, data processing would be the first priority.

2. the second priority, then you have a declaration, the research for solutions, for what is the best model from initial models that take me to the desired output.

3. the third priority will be test, test, test. Test that your code words. Test against edge cases. Test!
