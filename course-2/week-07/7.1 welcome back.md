# Welcome back

**It's week 7! Time to commence your penultimate sprint! How have you found the videos so far?**

This week marks the start of Sprint 3. As always, check OnTrack for your tasks! Your Scope should be fairly stable now, and I advise locking it to prevent further changes.

Your deliverables are:

1) Your Individual Retrospective
2) Your Grade Milestone Report (if you want to get Credit and above)
3) Your Team Worklog (+ Meeting Minutes)
