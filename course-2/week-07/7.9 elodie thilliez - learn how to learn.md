# Elodie Thilliez - learn how to learn

**Elodie is a Data Scientist at DSTIL.**

Elodie's background is in astrophysics and supercomputing.

"I was already doing a lot of data analytics during my PhD, and I was curious about machine learning, about AI."

"It was just maybe in the final couple of years of my final degree when I realised that there was more opportunities maybe in data science, and became really interested in it."

"It was definitely career migration. I just felt like being an astrophysicist requires a lot of moves, a lot of short-term contract. And at the same time, you were working on the same project for entire career. And I was looking forward to trying to do different things."
