# Nicola Pastorello - find out what makes you happy

**Nicola is Head of Data Science at Daisee, which is an AI-focused company for enterprises in Australia based in Australia.**

Nicola studied astronomy in Italy, and then astrophysics as a master. He moved to Australia to pursue a PhD in astrophysics.

"I could say that I started data science or working with machine learning more specifically since halfway through my PhD, applied to astrophysics problems. It wasn't really part of my curriculum, it was just an extra interest I had."

"I wanted to see if I could apply machine learning to astrophysics research. The sad answer is that, nope, you can't, not because you can't physically, but just because the community wasn't ready for those kind of methods and approaches."

"You get amazing models working perfectly well, high accuracies, but explainability is something you have to trade off for that."
