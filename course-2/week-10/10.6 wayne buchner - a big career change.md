**Wayne is the Lead iOS Developer for Coroma Consulting.**

"I think as a lead, my job is to support the rest of the team even though I have my own responsibilities. So I support them. My boss supports me. And if there's anything that I can see that our team requires in order to improve our workflow, make our jobs better, make the environment a little bit more fun, then that's what I feel my job is."

"I had a very clear focus in mind about what I was going to do, and that was going to be mobile."

"But you've got to be stubborn and persistent. You've got to keep going."
