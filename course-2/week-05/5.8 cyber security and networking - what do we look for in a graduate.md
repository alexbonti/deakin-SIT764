# Cyber security and networking - what do we look for in a graduate?

**We spoke with Damien and Kathryn about what they look for when interviewing a candidate. Do you have what they are looking for?**

**Damien Manuel**

"I look for somebody who's hungry for knowledge, somebody who has good personal skillsâ€“ interpersonal relationships skills. Somebody that I feel you can make a connection with, and who would be good at connecting with other people within an organisation."

**Kathryn Manuel**

"We look for a can-do attitude. And we look for somebody who displays that they've got capability and willingness to learn. Beyond those basic skills, the key thing that we really look at during interviews is whether we think the person sitting in front of us is a good cultural fit for our organisation. And that is really key."

"So, being a well-rounded person is really, really important. Because your interactions on so many other things can actually change the way that you think. And that's really important."
