# Advice from cyber security and networking practitioners

**Listen to the advice Damien and Kathryn want to give their past self. How does it relate to you and your career goals?**

**Damien Manuel**

"If you feel you're not learning new things, where you're being employed, and that's the time to start looking or asking for new challenges."

"I definitely think individuals who can think differently, who are inquisitive, and want to understand how something works will make great cyber-security individuals. It's that need to understand how something can function, and how you may be able to exploit that, whether it's either through breaking a process, or finding a loophole, or exploiting that sort of social engineering, human element."

**Kathryn Manuel**

"Probably the advice I would give myself is stay open to opportunities. Don't be narrow minded and think this is my degree. And so this is the career path I'm on. Because clearly a nursing degree to cyber security is not a really clear trajectory."

"In this discipline you have to have a continuous learning mindset."
