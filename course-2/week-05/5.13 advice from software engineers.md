# Advice from software engineers

**Let's look at some lessons you could learn from the experiences of three software engineers Olga, Wayne and Zoey.**

**Olga Goloshchapova**

"I don't assume that I know everything. I turn around and I say to people, I would like to see or hear your opinions."

"But, at the same time, you do need to be fairly technically sound to validate that the decision the team is making are correct and they don't introduce high-risk situations."

**Wayne Buchner**

"I probably would say, make sure whatever you do, you finish a degree. Because a degree shows somebody that you can dedicate x amount of years to something. And, if it was between this person and this person in a resume, and this person had done a degree, but this person hadn't– but they were both equally as talented, I'd take the person, probably, in the end, with a degree."

"So patience, learning– the thirst for learning. And I've got to be honest, I don't get to do enough of it. Communicating with others, and being able to express not only what you feel, but back that up with evidence."

**Zoey Bendef**

"Because, in the world of software, things are frequently changing. And you can be in a project and it will change in the middle, and you have to learn something completely new that you've never done before."
