# Artificial intelligence and data science as a career

**What are the skills you should have to enter a career in these disciplines? We asked a few experts, and this is what they say.** 

**Elodie Thilliez**

"I think one of the most important things that I would be looking at someone who is curious, and is eager to learn. And I know for example, some people when they graduate, they are done with learning. But that's a very bad attitude to have."

**Nicola Pastorello**

"High priority, if somebody is eager to learn, and enthusiast. Those are the first big check. Second thing on the second level, of course coding skills. And statistics that I was saying is, at least some understanding of statistics. Mostly by using statistics."

**Mohamed Abdelrazek**

"I think you probably need to be able to work in teams. That's a very important thing."

## Your task
Are you eager to learn and curious? How would you demonstrate this in an interview?
