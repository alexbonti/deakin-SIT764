# Gender and diversity in STEM

**Listen to female IT practitioners talk about gender and diversity in IT.**

Practitioners interviewed agree that diversity is important, and not just gender diversity:

* ideally we have more diversity of all sortsâ€“ so gender, culture, age, other forms of diversity as well, to have just really balanced teams. Because ultimately you're building something for end customers that are quite diverse as well.

* diversity means to me not just gender diversity. It's race, attitudes, backgrounds. It's sexual preferences. It's gender. And it's different professional backgrounds. All of it contributes to the nice variety of perspectives.

* I would say diversity is just having a wide range of viewpoints and opinions and people in any given topic or area.
