# Addressing challenges in team dynamics

**Working within a team will not always be easy. You may sometimes find that team dynamics can be quite challenging. How would you deal with this?**

**Olga Goloshchapova**

"Give each other feedback in a nice, polite, and respectful manner."

**Olivia Platek**

"I've come across someone who is maybe a bit hostile, particularly coming in as a consultant, there's plenty reasons for people to feel threatened, or concerned, or upset, or just hesitant and resistant to changing their way of working. But, they can be quite hostile, you take them out for a cup, you ask them if they got kids, if they've got family. You talk about your run down cars together, or whatever else you have in common. And, suddenly, the next day work is easier."

**Zoey Bendef**

"I find that, in my experience of group projects, they get derailed very quickly if someone, for instance, stops working, or makes excuses and doesn't show up, or doesn't communicate for days or weeks on end."

**Anju Curumsing**

"It would be good to bring together everyone, sit and talk about it, and be frank, be honest to people."
